Deep Learning for Text Summarization

Problem Description: The objective of this project is to implement a Deep Reinforcement Learning based system for text summarization and question answering. Given a source text document or chat history, the system should perform the following tasks:
Text Summarization: Generate a concise and coherent summary of the input text, capturing the essential information.
Web or Mobile Application: Develop a user-friendly application.

Key Requirements and Features:
Reward Functions: Design reward functions for both text summarization. Quantify the quality of the generated summary compared to human-authored summaries.
Model Architecture: Implement a DRL architecture that can effectively learn the summarization task. This may involve a combination of deep neural networks, reinforcement learning algorithms, and attention mechanisms.
Deployment: Create a user-friendly interface that allows users to input source text or chat conversations, and receive generated summaries in real-time. Deploy the system as a web application or mobile application.
Fine-Tuning: Implement mechanisms for fine-tuning the model with user feedback to adapt to specific user requirements and preferences.
Evaluation Metrics: 
Text Summarization Metrics:
BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)
ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)
User-interactivity and User-friendliness.

Expected Outcomes:
The project aims to develop a cutting-edge DRL-based text summarization that can be used in various applications, including content summarization, chatbots, and document retrieval. The system should produce high-quality summaries and accurate answers, enhancing user access to information and knowledge.
